// HTTP engine files - included here because these are private files but we want to inherit from them
// This is not pretty nor good but is the only way to extend these classes without modifying engine code

// The approach we take here is that we want to use the CurlHttp provided by Unreal but we need to make a few
// changes and so can't use it directly. We also do not want to impose engine changes.

// The changes we need to make are in order to support HTTP chunked transfers:
//
// 1. Prevent the Content-Length header being automatically added as this is not needed for chunked transfers
// 2. Reset the post field size to default so that it doesn't prematurely stop the transfer
// 3. Add support for pausing and resuming requests using our own read function
